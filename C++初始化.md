# C++初始化

1. 初始化：指在构造一个变量的时候提供初始值。

   > *Initialization* of a variable provides its initial value at the time of construction.
   >
   > The initial value may be provided in the initializer section of a [declarator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations) or a [new expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new). It also takes place during function calls: function parameters and the function return values are also initialized.
